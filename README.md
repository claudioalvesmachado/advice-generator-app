## My process

### Built with

- Mobile-first workflow
- Javascript

### What I learned

Well, it's the first time I use an API, so I learned how consume them using ``` fetch() ```.

### Continued development

For sure I want to develop more projects consuming APIs and, of course, learn how to create my own.
